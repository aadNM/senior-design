# Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Increase security within your network by adding an additional authentication method besides username and password.

**Available methods:**

- Email
- Time-based one-time passwords (e.g. Google Authenticator)

Administrators can individually define which user groups are required to use an additional authentication method.
For administrators themselves, a second authentication method will be enabled by default.
