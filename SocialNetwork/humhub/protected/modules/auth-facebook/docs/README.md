# Facebook Sign-In

Using this module, users can directly log in or register with their Facebook credentials at this HumHub installation. 
A new button "Facebook" will appear on the login page.

## Configuration

Please follow the [Facebook instructions](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/async/login-with-facebook/) to create the required ` OAuth client ID` credentials.

Once you have the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** created there, the values must then be entered in the module configuration at: `Administration -> Modules -> Facebook Auth -> Configure`. 
This page also displays the `Authorized redirect URI`, which must be inserted in Facebook in the corresponding field.
