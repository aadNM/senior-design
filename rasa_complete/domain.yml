    I would like for you to be safe. Let's make a short and a long term safety plans.
    A short term plan could be
    - staying away from things that you can use to hurt yourself or others. 
    - And/or having a person you trust come stay with you for a while.
    - And/or oing something that helps you calm down and feel happy.
    Basically anything that can help you be safe right now.
    
    A long term plan could be
    - Talking with a professional. I can give links to sites where you can search for one.
    - And/or Using your support group,  if you have one.
    It is all about building a mechanism that helps you stay safe.
